# Kumiko Community App: Production Implementation Blueprint

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for converting the Kumiko Community demo application into a fully functional production system with robust infrastructure, advanced features, and scalable architecture.

---

## 1. System Architecture Overview

### Current Demo Architecture
- Flask web application with in-memory data storage
- Static HTML templates with Bootstrap and custom CSS
- Mock data stored in CSV files with placeholder image generation for missing community images
- No persistent database
- No user authentication system
- No payment processing capabilities

### Target Production Architecture
- **Web Application Layer**: 
  - Enhanced Flask application with Blueprint-based modular structure
  - API-driven architecture with separate frontend and backend components
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging

- **Database Layer**:
  - PostgreSQL for relational data (users, communities, relationships)
  - Redis for caching and session management
  - MongoDB for storing chat messages and activity feeds

- **Authentication Layer**:
  - OAuth 2.0 integration for social login (Google, Facebook, Twitter)
  - JWT-based token authentication
  - Role-based access control system

- **Payment Processing Layer**:
  - Stripe integration for subscription and one-time payments
  - Payment analytics and reporting dashboard
  - Automated invoice generation

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Docker containerization for consistent deployment
  - Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling
  - AWS/Azure/GCP cloud hosting with auto-scaling
  - CDN integration for static assets

## 2. Database Implementation Plan

### Database Schema

1. **Users Table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE users (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
     password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     full_name VARCHAR(100),
     bio TEXT,
     profile_image_url VARCHAR(255),
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
     updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
     last_login TIMESTAMP,
     is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
     role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'user'
   );
   ```

2. **Communities Table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE communities (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
     description TEXT,
     category VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
     image_url VARCHAR(255),
     created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
     updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
     created_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
     is_private BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
     member_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
     is_featured BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
   );
   ```

3. **Memberships Table**
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE memberships (
     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
     user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
     community_id INTEGER REFERENCES communities(id),
     joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
     status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'active', -- active, pending, banned
     is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
     UNIQUE(user_id, community_id)
   );
   ```

4. **Messages Collection (MongoDB)**
   ```javascript
   {
     _id: ObjectId,
     conversation_id: String,
     sender_id: Integer,
     content: String,
     sent_at: Timestamp,
     read_by: [Integer],
     attachments: [
       {
         type: String,
         url: String,
         name: String,
         size: Integer
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Conversations Collection (MongoDB)**
   ```javascript
   {
     _id: ObjectId,
     participants: [Integer],
     created_at: Timestamp,
     updated_at: Timestamp,
     last_message: {
       content: String,
       sender_id: Integer,
       sent_at: Timestamp
     }
   }
   ```

### Migration Strategy
1. Create PostgreSQL database with the defined schema
2. Develop data migration scripts to convert CSV data to SQL INSERT statements
3. Implement indexing strategy for optimal query performance
4. Set up MongoDB collections for non-relational data
5. Implement data validation and integrity checks
